# [WIP] Mungbean
A simple JSON munger

## Configuration
 - `input`: the data to munge
 - `outputPath`: path to write output
 - `strategy`: the processing steps to take

## Strategies
Mungbean makes a couple common munging processes available

## Running
The munger will run using `nodemon`. Saving a file will trigger another munge run
```
npm start
```
